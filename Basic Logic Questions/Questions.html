    <dt>1.What is JavaScript. How to use it? </dt>
    <dd>
        JavaScript is lightweight ,crossplatform,single threaded and event based and interpreted compile based programming language.
        it is also known as scripting for website. and it also known as dynamically typed or loosly typed programming language.
        JavaScript is also used both side frontend side as well as backend side. 
    </dd>
    <dd>
        there are two ways to use js 
        (1)Internally  (2)Externally.
        in Internally you write the code inside in script tag.you can use in a body tag or in a head tag. better way u write the code in body tag.
        (2).Externally you can add a script tag link in a body tag. 
    </dd>

       2. How many type of Variable in JavaScript? 
    </dt>
    <dd>
        There are three type of variable in JavaScript (1)var (2)let (3)const
        var =>var variable is used to you can change multiple time variable's declartion and value.
        let =>let variable is used to you can't redeclare variable and value you can change multiple time     
        const => const variable is used to you can' redeclare variable and their value. 
    </dd>

    <dt>
        3. Define a Data Types in js?
    </dt> 
        <dd>

            data types define the kind of values that variables can hold and the operations that can be performed on them. 
            there are two type of data types in js
            (1)Primitive Data Types
            =>String represent 'text value' or 'quotation value' it is created with ("",'');
            =>number represent numerical value, it is create with (12939).
            =>boolean represent boolean value, there are only two value (true or false).
            =>symbol it is unique and it is immutable (the value can't change).
            =>null it is empty value it is not stored nothing and it is object.
            =>undefined means the variable is declared but it is not initialized.
            =>Big int it is stored high level integer value and (n) is append.

        </dd>
        <dd>
            (2)Non Primitive data type
            (1)Array
            Array is collection of multiple data type or single data type.
            (2)object is entity,which is exist in the real world like books ,car.
        </dd>

            5. What the deference between undefined and undeclare in JavaScript?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            undefined means the variable is declared but it is not initialized.and when you run this program then that time show undefined.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            undeclare also known not defined the variable is not declared and when you run this program then that time show not defined.
        </dd>

        <dt>
            10. What is Condition Statement?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.
            there are several condition statements
            <dd>if Statement</dd>
            <dd>if-else Statement</dd>
            <dd>else if Statement</dd>
            <dd>switch Statement</dd>
            <dd>Ternary Operator</dd>
        </dd>
        <dt>
            18. What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ?
          </dt>
        <dd>
            <!-- Switch statement -->
            JavaScript switch statement is used to execute a block of code from multiple expressions.

            JavaScript switch statement evaluates an expression. The expressionâ€™s value is compared with the values of each case in the structure. If a match is found, the related block of code is executed.

            <!-- Loops -->

            There are three loops 
            (1)For loop (2)while-loop (3)do-while loop

            Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

            for loop and while loop is entry control loop and do while loop is exit control loop.
            beacuse for loop and while loop first check their condition and after execute their statement and 
            do-while first print their statement and after check conditon. 
                </dd>

                <dt>19. What is the use of is Nan function?  </dt>
                <dd>
                    isNan function is provide boolean statement true and false.
                    (is Not a number).
                    if the given value is not a number or a string value. that provide true value.
                    and if the given value is a number then that time provide false value.
                </dd>

                <dt>20. What is the difference between && and || in JavaScript? </dt>
                <dd>Logical and(&&) and Logical or(||) both are used to check the condition</dd>
                <dd></dd>
            </dl>
  <script>

    let a=20;
    a='helllo'
    console.log(isNaN(a));

  </script>
