        3. Define a Data Types in js?
    </dt> 
        <dd>

            data types define the kind of values that variables can hold and the operations that can be performed on them. 
            there are two type of data types in js
            (1)Primitive Data Types
            =>String represent 'text value' or 'quotation value' it is created with ("",'');
            =>number represent numerical value, it is create with (12939).
            =>boolean represent boolean value, there are only two value (true or false).
            =>symbol it is unique and it is immutable (the value can't change).
            =>null it is empty value it is not stored nothing and it is object.
            =>undefined means the variable is declared but it is not initialized.
            =>Big int it is stored high level integer value and (n) is append.

        </dd>
        <dd>
            (2)Non Primitive data type
            (1)Array
            Array is collection of multiple data type or single data type.
            (2)object is entity,which is exist in the real world like books ,car.

        </dt>
        <dd>
            Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.
            there are several condition statements
            <dd>if Statement</dd>
            <dd>if-else Statement</dd>
            <dd>else if Statement</dd>
            <dd>switch Statement</dd>
            <dd>Ternary Operator</dd>
        </dd>
